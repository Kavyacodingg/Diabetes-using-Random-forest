# Diabetes-using-Random-forest
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting diabetes using the Random Forest classification algorithm. The model will be trained on a dataset 
Number of Pregnancies
Glucose Level
Blood Pressure Level
Skin Thickness
Insulin Level
Body Mass Index (BMI)
Diabetes Pedigree Function (optional)
Age
Outcome (Diabetic or Non-Diabetic)
Key functionalities:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the diabetes dataset for model training. This might involve handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
Random Forest Model Training: Train a Random Forest classifier on the preprocessed data. The model will learn to identify patterns and relationships between the health parameters and the presence of diabetes.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained Random Forest model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction: Allow users to input their health data and receive a prediction on whether they are likely to have diabetes (based on the trained model).
Project Benefits:

Early Detection: This project can potentially aid in the early detection of diabetes by identifying individuals at risk.
Improved Healthcare Management: Early diagnosis can lead to better management of diabetes and prevent complications.
Educational Tool: The project can be used as an educational tool to raise awareness about diabetes and its risk factors.
